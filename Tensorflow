what is tensorflow?
                    Tensorflow are the standard way of reresenting data in deep learning;
                    tensors are just multidimensional arraysm, an extension of two-dimensional tables(matrices) to data with higher
                      dimension.

 Tensorflow core programs consists of two discrete sections:1).Building a computational g4raph
