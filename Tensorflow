what is tensorflow?
                    Tensorflow are the standard way of reresenting data in deep learning;
                    tensors are just multidimensional arraysm, an extension of two-dimensional tables(matrices) to data with higher
                      dimension.

                      flow: data flow graph 
                      
 Tensorflow core programs consists of two discrete sections:1).Building a computational graph
                                                            2).Running a computational graph


A computational graph is a series of tensorflow operations arranged into a graph of nodes ointo a graph of nodes :
     let`s build a simple computational graph .
     each node takes zero or more tensors as inputs and produces a tensor as an output.

                                  :             node 1 = tf.constant(3.0,tf.float32)---------:
